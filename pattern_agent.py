        3. Rounded Bottom: Gradual price decline followed by a gradual rise, forming a 'U' shape.

        5. Falling Wedge: Price narrows downward, usually breaks out upward.
        6. Rising Wedge: Price rises slowly but converges, often breaks down.
        7. Ascending Triangle: Rising support line with a flat resistance on top, breakout often occurs upward.
        8. Descending Triangle: Falling resistance line with flat support at the bottom, typically breaks down.
        9. Bullish Flag: After a sharp rise, price consolidates downward briefly before continuing upward.
        10. Bearish Flag: After a sharp drop, price consolidates upward briefly before continuing downward.
        11. Rectangle: Price fluctuates between horizontal support and resistance.
        12. Island Reversal: Two price gaps in opposite directions forming an isolated price island.
        13. V-shaped Reversal: Sharp decline followed by sharp recovery, or vice versa.
        14. Rounded Top / Rounded Bottom: Gradual peaking or bottoming, forming an arc-shaped pattern.
        15. Expanding Triangle: Highs and lows increasingly wider, indicating volatile swings.
        16. Symmetrical Triangle: Highs and lows converge toward the apex, usually followed by a breakout.
